# MLOps Predictive Maintenance

This project showcases a complete MLOps workflow for predictive maintenance, leveraging modern machine learning and automation practices to predict machinery failures before they happen.

## Objective

To proactively detect potential machine failures using historical telemetry, and failure data. The ultimate goal is to reduce unplanned downtime through accurate failure predictions integrated into automated ML pipelines.

## Tech Stack

- **ZenML** – MLOps pipeline orchestration  
- **scikit-learn** – Model training and evaluation  
- **pandas / numpy** – Data manipulation  
- **joblib** – Model serialization  
- **Hugging Face Spaces** – Optional deployment interface
