## Technical Summary

### What has been achieved

In this first phase of the project, a Random Forest machine learning model was built to predict whether a machine will fail within the next 24 hours, based on sensor readings such as voltage, rotation, pressure, and vibration. The solution includes robust feature engineering using 3-hour rolling windows and automatic labeling of upcoming failures based on time-based conditions.

Beyond the model itself, the full ML lifecycle was automated using modular pipelines built with ZenML. These pipelines cover preprocessing, training, evaluation, model saving, and prediction stepsâ€”ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and a well-structured workflow.

### Strategic focus

The project deliberately prioritized model simplicity in order to focus on building a clean and reproducible automation pipeline. Technical decisions emphasized clarity, traceability, and maintainability over complexity or accuracy, especially in this initial version.

This allowed us to lay a strong foundation for future scaling and iterative improvements, making it easier to evolve the system toward a production-ready architecture.

## Production Readiness and Next Steps

While the current system is fully functional and demonstrates the potential of predictive maintenance using machine learning, it is not yet ready for a robust production deployment. Several critical components are still missing to ensure scalability, maintainability, and operational stability.

Currently, the solution runs in a local or prototype environment and is not yet deployed to a cloud infrastructure. As a result, it lacks essential features such as auto-scaling, managed compute resources, and reliable uptime. The dashboard, while useful, is not connected to live data sources and requires manual updates. There is also no CI/CD mechanism in place, making updates and deployments manual and error-prone. Moreover, the system does not include monitoring capabilities to detect failures or performance issues once in production. Lastly, data management is handled locally, without centralized storage to ensure consistent access across pipeline runs.

### Recommended Next Steps

- **Deploy the system on cloud infrastructure** (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) to support scalability, availability, and long-term operation.
- **Integrate centralized data storage** to manage input/output data for training and inference consistently.
- **Establish a CI/CD workflow** to automate testing, validation, and deployment of pipelines and code changes.
- **Enable continuous monitoring** to track data anomalies, system errors, and potential model degradation in real time.

These enhancements will ensure the solution can evolve into a production-grade system, capable of operating reliably and delivering real-time insights at scale.
